Play Silhouette Angular4 Seed Project
=====================================

This is an ongoing work and needs to be refined. The OAuth2 authentication is using un unsafe workaround (follow updates [here](http://discourse.silhouette.rocks/t/silhouette-and-angular/159/10)). Plenty of cleanup needs to be done as well.

The Play Silhouette Angular Seed project shows how [Silhouette](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette) can be used
to create a SPA with [Angular](https://angular.io/)/[ng2-ui-auth](https://github.com/ronzeidman/ng2-ui-auth). It's a starting point which can be extended to fit
your needs. It was migrated from the existing seed with AngularJS: [play-silhouette-angular-seed](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-angular-seed).
