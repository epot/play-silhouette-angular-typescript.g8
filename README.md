Play Silhouette Angular4 Seed Project
=====================================

This is an ongoing work and plan to be in a working state by mid august 2017.

The Play Silhouette Angular Seed project shows how [Silhouette](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette) can be used
to create a SPA with [Angular](https://angular.io/)/[Satellizer](https://github.com/sahat/satellizer) and Play
scaffolded by [yeoman](https://github.com/tuplejump/play-yeoman). It's a starting point which can be extended to fit
your needs. It was migrated from the existing seed with [AngularJS](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-angular-seed).
